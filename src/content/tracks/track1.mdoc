## Overview

The Plastic Pollution and Health Impacts track investigates the growing challenge of microplastic contamination in terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. This research area examines detection methodologies, environmental fate, bioaccumulation patterns, and potential health consequences for wildlife and humans exposed to microplastics.

## Key Research Areas

### Detection and Characterization

Accurate identification and analysis of microplastics is fundamental to understanding their environmental impacts. Current research focuses on:

- Advanced spectroscopic and imaging techniques for microplastic identification
- Field-deployable technologies for rapid microplastic detection
- Standardized protocols for sampling and analysis across different environmental matrices
- Particle size distribution and polymer type characterization

### Environmental Pathways and Fate

Understanding how microplastics move through and persist in different ecosystems is critical for assessing exposure risks:

- Transport and sedimentation patterns in aquatic ecosystems
- Weathering and degradation processes of different polymer types
- Interactions between microplastics and other environmental contaminants
- Modeling approaches for predicting environmental distribution

### Biological Impacts and Health Effects

Research on how microplastics affect living organisms spans from cellular to ecosystem levels:

- Uptake, translocation, and tissue accumulation mechanisms
- Toxicological effects on aquatic and terrestrial organisms
- Trophic transfer and biomagnification in food webs
- Potential human health implications from dietary and respiratory exposure
- Microplastics as vectors for microbial communities and contaminants

## Join This Track

We welcome submissions addressing any aspect of microplastic pollution in ecosystems and its implications for environmental and human health. Multidisciplinary approaches that combine environmental science, toxicology, analytical chemistry, and public health perspectives are particularly encouraged.
